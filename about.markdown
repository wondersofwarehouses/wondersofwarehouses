*On the Wonders of Warehouses* is a critical urban studies zine exploring the role of deindustrialization in developing artistic and counter-cultural movements. Based out of Queens, New York, it highlights the post-industrial landscape of Americaâ€™s most diverse county as it grapples with a regional housing crisis. 

This project draws significant inspiration from the Situationist International, a movement of avant-garde artists and intellectuals established in 1957, whose works were foundational in establishing the field of critical urban studies. In addition to original writings, *On the Wonders of Warehouses* is supplemented by relevant works from the Situationists.
